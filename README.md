# Advent of Code in C\#

I recently heard from [theprimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen) that he loves doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) every year to learn a new language or improve upon language skill. This year, I'm going to join, and write in C\#, to learn more about setting up projects, maybe writing terminal apps, etc.

Day One Complete!
